[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> Because each number has an equal probability of being generated, the PMF represents a continous graph of bars along the x-axis mapped to the same height on the y-axis. The cdf below is nearly uniform but not perfectly uniform, illustrated by the slope of the line being fluctuating slightly. The random function does not generate perfectly random samples.
