[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> The mean weight of first babies is 7.20 lbs and the mean weight of all others is 7.33 lbs -- first babies in this sample are lighter. The Cohen's d effect size on weight is .089 standard deviations. A measurement less than .2 is considered small. The Cohen's d effect size on pregnancy length is .029 standard deviations. Therefor, the effect size on total weight is larger than the effect size on pregnancy length.
