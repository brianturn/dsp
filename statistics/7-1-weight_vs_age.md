[Think Stats Chapter 7 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2008.html#toc70) (weight vs. age)

>> We can see that there is a very small positive correlation between the mothe's age and the baby's weight. The Pearson's correlation coefficient is 0.0688 and the Spearman Rank coefficient is .0946. The correlation is hard to visualize in the scatter plot below, but is more apparent in the percentile mapping, where we can see weight increasing with age, but then decreasing for the oldest mother's (above 37).<\br>
