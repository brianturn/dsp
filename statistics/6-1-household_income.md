>> With an upper bound of $1M, the mean is pulled to the right of the median, creating positive skew. A larger upper bound would create larger skew.

>> 66% fall below the mean (with upper bound $1M).

>> -Median = $51,226</br>
-Mean = $74,278</br>
-Skewness = 4.94</br>
-Pearson Median Skewness = .73</br>

>> With an upper bound of $10M, 85% fall below the mean.
